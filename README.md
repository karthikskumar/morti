# morti

Morti is my home automation project.
The idea is to build a system that takes "automation" beyond what IFTTT or Virtaul assistant can provide.

Conpceptual Examples:
1. When it is about to get dark outside, Morti (the system) turns on the lights inside. Blinds are also automatically closed.
2. If Morti notices that some items come on at a certain time, or notices periodicity, it will attempt to automate it.
3. Morti can be "taught" to interact with new devices by updating instructions on a csv file.
